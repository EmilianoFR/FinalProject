Izzys Shelter App is a gui application designed to allow users to
navigate through an animal shelters current "inventory" of animals 
available to adopt. 

The program works by creating a main window that has tw buttons, one
that leads you to a catalog of the current animals available with buttons
on the page that will provide the animals basic information such as
their given name, age, gender and if they have been neutered or spayed.
The second button on the main window opens an inquiry form that the user
can then fill out with their contact information so that they can get
in touch with the shelter in regards to adopting one of the animals posted
in the applpication. 

From the shelters perspective they can go in and add new animals whenever by
creating new variables with the new animals information, or if an animal 
gets adopted their information can simply be swapped out with another so that
the "slot" remains the same but changes to a new animal. All information
regarding the pets is stored in a class seperate from the main programs class
so that it can be easily formatted and accessed when updating their system.

The inquiry form window prompts the user to enter basic contact information
such as their name, phone, email, and also the name of the pet they're inquiring 
for. To prevent users from entering invalid information, the text boxes are
programmed to only accept certain characters depending on the information that's
meant to go in the text box. For example numbers are not able to be typed within 
the "Name" boxes and letters can't be entered within the "Phone" box.
